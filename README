CD STRUCTURE:
The cd has 3 folders:
    src    - The directory that contains all source code for this project.
             Code for this project is written in C++, with a little bit of C
             in order to use the GLUT and OpenGL libraries.
             

    bin    - The directory that the compilation process places executables.


    meshes - The directory that contains all the sample meshes available for
             this project. All the meshes contained in this folder are 
             Wavefront OBJ file format.


GENERATION OF EXECUTABLES:
In the top directory "mesh_refine", run the command:
    make

This will create all the binaries associated with this project. If you wish to 
compile them separately, there are three executables to make:


VIEWER:
    The executable used for viewing OBJ file format meshes. To compile this
    run the command:

        make viewer

OBJ:
    The executable used for testing the OBJ file format libraries, as well as
    a more complex copying of OBJ files. To compile this run the command:
        
        make obj

SIMPLIFY:
    The heart of the project, this executable performs mesh simplification on
    the OBJ files of your choice. To compile this, run the command:
    
        make simplify
